To attract investments of a completely different scale, for example, to launch 
large-scale production, investment strategies are being developed at the level 
of cities and states and attractive conditions are being created: they reduce 
taxes, simplify bureaucratic procedures, develop infrastructure, and stimulate 
demand for products.
We can say that regions and cities compete with each other, creating an attractive 
investment climate in order to attract more promising investors and attract large 
capital to their region.
For residents, investments in the economy are very profitable. In sities that 
attract more investment, the number of jobs increases, the standard of living 
increases, and the social sphere develops.
